i think there are 2 approaches here:

both ones need:
--> new Entity SquaremeterType
--> new Entity Squaremeter
--> CartItem: extend by column squaremeterType and squaremeter

a) Project: extend by column type(TREE and SQUAREMETER)
--> ProjectArticle: extend by column squaremeterType
--> ProjectArticle: remove not null constraint from treeType and add squaremeterType

consequences:
--> all queries on existing projects has to be extended by type parameter to avoid loading squaremeter projects
	--> this is possibly a huge and risky change to really find all occurences for this
--> on all views it has to be determined whether it's a tree or squaremeter project	to show the correct components

b) create complete new Project entity -> SquaremeterProject
--> new Entity ProjectSquaremeterArticle with foreign key on SquaremeterType

consequences:
--> complete new layer(repo, service, controller) to handle these
--> the frontend has to call always both ones to get all projects(overview, plant suggestions etc)



i would prefere approach b
--> easier to handle
--> no risk to forget something and cause NPEs or something else
